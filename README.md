# tokeru
Fade in and out effects for Roblox UI

## Introduction

tokeru (溶ける) is the Japanese word for dissolve. Filmmakers uses the term dissolve as a transition that involves either fade in or fade out. That's the meaning of the name of this project.

With tokeru, you can fine-tune your UI with much natural transitions, rather than having UI appears instantly. You can also combine tokeru with tweens/springs to build much amazing transitions, such as fade and scale up.

## Installation

tokeru can be installed with Wally, simply add tokeru in your Wally configuration for the project.
